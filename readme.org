warning:
As of approximately May 25th and onwards, if anyone comes across this repo - please ignore this for GPT-4. 
GPT-4 seems to be nerfed significantly, which is unfortnate as it was insanely good with these thinking hats beforehand, almost felt conscious.
I haven't announced this repo publically so hopefully no damage done.



* What?
  This is a yaml prompt to paste in to prime and encourage various thought styles and thinking more with LLMs.  (pretty much only works with GPT-4 currently [or did see above warning]).

* Give it a go!
  1. Visit [[https://chat.openai.com/chat][ChatGPT]]
  2. Select the GPT-4 model
  3. Copy and paste the contents of [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richemslie/gpt4-thinkinghats/main/hats.yaml][hats.yaml]] into ChatGPT
  4. Ask it anything / tell it your problems!
  5. Profit

* And What?
  Base idea was taken from Edward De Bono's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats][Six Thinking Hats]]

  With some playing around and with GPT-4 feedback, we came up together with a bunch of hats suitable for LLMs.
