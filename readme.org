* Give it a go!
  1. Visit [[https://chat.openai.com/chat][ChatGPT]]
  2. Select the GPT-4 model
  3. Copy and paste the contents of [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richemslie/gpt4-thinkinghats/main/hats.yaml][hats.yaml]] into ChatGPT
  4. Ask it anything / tell it your problems!
  5. Profit

* And What?
  Base idea was taken from Edward De Bono's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats][Six Thinking Hats]]

  With some playing around and with GPT-4 feedback, we came up together with a bunch of hats suitable for LLMs.
